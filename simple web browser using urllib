#This imports urllib to Python
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error

#This part of the code stabilish the connection with the server, gets the file and encode the data.
fhand = urllib.request.urlopen('http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt')

#This part prints and decode the data from the adress
for line in fhand:

#The difference between this piece of code and the sockets piece is that urllib in this case will print only the file and not the headers information too.
